# Excel Data Analysis Project - Computer Repair Times

## Description
This project involves analyzing the repair times for computers to evaluate the impact of a process improvement program. The dataset includes 250 observations of the number of days taken to repair each computer.

## Key Findings
- **Mean Repair Time**: 14.912 days
- **Standard Deviation**: 5.958 days
- **Skewness**: 1.695 (positively skewed)
- **Kurtosis**: 4.079 (more peaked and heavy-tailed than normal distribution)
- **Range**: 5 to 40 days

## Hypothesis Testing
### Null Hypothesis (H0)
The average repair time is 14 days.

### Alternative Hypothesis (H1)
The average repair time is not 14 days.

The t-test result with a p-value of 4.79322E-77 strongly rejects the null hypothesis, indicating a significant difference in mean repair time before and after the process improvement program.

## Confidence Interval
- **95% Confidence Interval for Mean Repair Time**: (14.17, 15.65) days

## Conclusion
The process improvement program has significantly reduced the mean repair time. This reduction can lead to increased efficiency, cost savings, and improved customer satisfaction.

## Technologies Used
- Excel: Data analysis, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals
